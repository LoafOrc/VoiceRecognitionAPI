# VoiceRecognitionAPI
 Loads Windows Speech recognition into Lethal Company and provides a dev-friendly way of using it.

## What does this do for players?
In short - nothing. This is a simple API, instead other mods use methods from this mod to build their own features. So go check their feature list to see what voice commands they may offer.

## It doesn't work properly help!
If the mod is throwing an error use [the github issue page](https://github.com/LoafOrc/VoiceRecognitionAPI/issues) and copy-paste the error in there.

If it is loading correctly but isn't detecting your voice:
 - Make sure you have set your [default microphone](https://www.howtogeek.com/700440/how-to-choose-your-default-microphone-on-windows-10/) correctly.
 - Enable `LogRecognitionResults` in the mod config, found at `(LethalCompanyDir)/BepInEx/config/me.loaforc.voicewrapperapi.cfg`. If it is getting wrong results try [improving your speech recognition](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-voice-recognition-in-windows-83ff75bd-63eb-0b6c-18d4-6fae94050571#:~:text=In%20Control%20Panel%2C%20select%20Ease,to%20set%20up%20speech%20recognition.)
